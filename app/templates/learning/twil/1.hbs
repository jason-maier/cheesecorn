    <h4><b>Some Awesome Ember Helpers: notEmpty and isEmpty</b></h4>
    <p class="plantContent">
      This week these Ember helpers really helped me out. I was trying to work with some properties
      on an endpoint that would in some cases return null. Obviously using something like `reads` for this
      would return an error. notEmpty and isEmpty to the rescue.
    </p>
    <p>
      <h5><b>notEmpty</b></h5>
      <blockquote>
        A computed property that returns true if the value of the dependent property is NOT null, an empty string, empty array, or empty function.

    <h4><b>Route Info Metadata</b></h4>
    <p class="plantContent">
      This was mostly inspired by <a target="_blank" href="https://embermap.com/topics/what-s-new-in-ember/routeinfo-metadata-3-10">a great EmberMap video</a> I watched this week.
      I used what I learned in this video to create the breadcrumbs for this website.

      buildRouteInfoMetadata, which is what is used to build the metadata field that was added to RouteInfo was introduced in <a href="https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0398-RouteInfo-Metadata.md">this RFC</a>.
      They explain their motivation below:
      </span>
      <blockquote>
        While the RouteInfo object is sufficient in providing developers metadata about the Route itself, it is not sufficient in layering on application specific metadata about the Route. This metadata could be anything from a more domain-specific name for a Route, e.g. profile_page vs profile.index, all the way to providing contextual data when the Route was visited.
      </blockquote>
    </p>
    <p class="plantContent">
      RouteInfo.metadata is an optional field. Its value will be whatever you define in buildRouteInfoMetadata.
    </p>
    <p class="plantContent">
      The below example defines the name of the breadcrumb for my index route.
      If I returned model instead of 'Cheesecorn' the breadcrumb would show up as index which is a bit less intuitive.
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code class='language-javascript'>
        buildRouteInfoMetadata() {
          return {
            breadcrumb() {
              return 'Cheesecorn';
            }
          };
        }
