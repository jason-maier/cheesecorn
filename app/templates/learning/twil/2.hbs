    <h4><b>System Fonts</b></h4>
    <p class="plantContent">
      Recently we moved over the product I work on from a set of custom fonts to system fonts. From a technical standpoint
      I understood why we were doing this. From a design standpoint I was super confused why it was so easy to get support for
      this initiative. My understanding of system fonts meant that by introducing them to the produce means introducing a great deal
      of variability to your product since you lose a bit of control over what it's going to look like since it will look a bit different
      depending on the device.

    <p class="plantContent">
      That was until I read this <a target='_blank' href='https://medium.com/needmore-notes/using-system-fonts-for-web-apps-bf76d214a0e0'>incredible Medium article</a>
      and had more conversations that I finally had my "a-ha" moment about system fonts.
      <b>At the end of the day, system fonts simply makes the interface look like a user expects.</b>
    </p>
    <p class="plantContent">
      This means that if a user is using our product and switches over to Github, <a target='_blank' href='https://css-tricks.com/shipping-system-fonts-github-com/'>
        which also uses a system font stack and wrote a great article on the process
      </a>, they don't have to acclimate to a different font environment.

      Even in the few days after this changed was released I feel like I have to think less to find the things I need to find.
      This is a very nice thing for an interface I have to stare at for hours at a time.

      This quote from the previously mentioned <a target='_blank' href='https://medium.com/needmore-notes/using-system-fonts-for-web-apps-bf76d214a0e0'>Medium article</a>
      succinctly sums up what it took me a second to comprehend.

    <blockquote>
      Users will appreciate it, even if they canâ€™t put their finger on why.

    <h4><b>Which goes first the header or the link?</b></h4>
    <p class="plantContent">
      This is a quick and cool thing I learned this week from some pull request feedback and this <a target="_blank" href="https://css-tricks.com/link-header-header-link/">CSS Tricks article</a> that was sent to me.
    </p>
    Some examples to understand what the difference is.
    <pre><code class='language-markup multi'>
      &lt;h1>
        &lt;a href='/learning/twil/2'>
          Header then link
        &lt;/a>
      &lt;/h1>

      &lt;a href='/learning/twil/2'>
        &lt;h1>
          Header then link
        &lt;/h1>
      &lt;/a>
    </code></pre>
    <p class="plantContent">
      The CSS tricks article does a great job of explaining the differences. My maint akeaway is that you should do headers then links because it makes
      the click area a bit more intuitive.
