        Recently we moved over the product I work on from a set of custom fonts to system fonts. From a technical standpoint
        I understood why we were doing this. From a design standpoint I was super confused why it was so easy to get support for
        this initiative. My understanding of system fonts meant that by introducing them to the produce means introducing a great deal
        of variability to your product since you lose a bit of control over what it's going to look like since it will look a bit different
        depending on the device.

        That was until I read this <a target='_blank' href='https://medium.com/needmore-notes/using-system-fonts-for-web-apps-bf76d214a0e0'>incredible Medium article</a>
        and had more conversations that I finally had my "a-ha" moment about system fonts.

        This means that if a user is using our product and switches over to Github, <a target='_blank' href='https://css-tricks.com/shipping-system-fonts-github-com/'>
          which also uses a system font stack and wrote a great article on the process
        </a>, they don't have to acclimate to a different font environment.

        Even in the few days after this changed was released I feel like I have to think less to find the things I need to find.
        This is a very nice thing for an interface I have to stare at for hours at a time.

        succinctly sums up what it took me a second to comprehend.

      <p class="mb-2">
        This is a quick and cool thing I learned this week from some pull request feedback and this <a target="_blank" href="https://css-tricks.com/link-header-header-link/">CSS Tricks article</a> that was sent to me.
      </p>
      Some examples to understand what the difference is.
      <pre><code class='language-markup multi'>
        &lt;h1>
          &lt;a href='/learning/twil/2'>
            Header then link
          &lt;/a>
        &lt;/h1>

        &lt;a href='/learning/twil/2'>
          &lt;h1>
            Header then link
          &lt;/h1>
        &lt;/a>
      </code></pre>
      <p class="mb-2">
        The CSS tricks article does a great job of explaining the differences. My maint akeaway is that you should do headers then links because it makes
        the click area a bit more intuitive.
